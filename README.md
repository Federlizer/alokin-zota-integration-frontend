## Getting Started

First, make sure that the `alokin` server is running and you're able to access it from your local machine. Then,
install and run the frontend's development server:

```bash
$ npm install

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the page and interact with the Zota API.
